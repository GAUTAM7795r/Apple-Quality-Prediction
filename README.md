# Apple-Quality-Prediction
Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create predictive classifiers to determine the quality of apples. These predictions are based on variables related to the quality of apples using features such as ripeness, crunchiness, weight, acidity, etc. The models can be utilized by farmers or produce sellers to determine the financial value of their product or to predict the quality of future anticipated harvests.
